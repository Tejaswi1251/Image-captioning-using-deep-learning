# Image-captioning-using-deep-learning
Image captioning is the process of generating descriptions about what is going on in the image,
Image Captioning is basically very much useful in many applications like analyzing large
amount of unlabeled images and finding hidden patterns of Machine Learning. CNN and LSTM
are used to identify the caption of the image. As the deep learning techniques are growing, huge
data sets and computer power are helpful to build models that can generate captions for an 
image.where we will use deep learning techniques like CNN, LSTM . Image caption 
generator is a process which involves natural language processing and computer vision concepts
to recognize the context of an image and present it in native language. Convolutional neural
networks were combined to extract features, recurrent neural networks and LSTM were utilized
to generate text from these features.
