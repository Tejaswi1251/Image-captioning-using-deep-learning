# Title of the Project : 
IMAGE CAPTIONING USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES

# Project idea:
 To build a simple image-captioning model using pre-trained CNN model and LSTM model, based on the Flickr8K dataset. This project is primarily for self-learning purpose, on how to build a deep-learning model using Tensorflow.

# Modules included in our Project:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Processing
3. Splitting Data into Train and Test
4. Building the Models
5. User Input
6. Prediction

## Data Exploration:
Purpose: Understand the characteristics and structure of the dataset.
Activities: Loading the data into the system, exploring basic statistics, visualizing data distributions, identifying patterns, and handling missing values.

## Data Processing:
Purpose: Preprocess the data to make it suitable for training machine learning models.
Activities: Cleaning data, handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and any other necessary transformations.

## Splitting Data into Train and Test:
Purpose: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Activities: Using a module to randomly split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

## Building the Model (CNN, LSTM, VGG16):
Purpose: Create machine learning models for prediction.
Activities: Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and the VGG16 architecture. This involves defining the model architecture, compiling the model, and training it on the training data.

## User Input:
Purpose: Allow users to input data for making predictions.
Activities: Designing a user interface or an API endpoint to accept input from users.

## Prediction:
Purpose: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Activities: Utilizing the trained models (CNN, LSTM, VGG16) to predict outcomes based on the user's input.

# Conclusion:
he Project explained about generating captions for the images. Even though deep learning is advanced upto now exact caption generation is not possible due to many reasons like hard ware requirements problem, no proper programming logic or model to generate the exact captions because machines cannot think or make decisions as accurately as human do.So in future withthe advancement of hardware and deep learning models it hope to generate captions with higher accuracy. It is also thought to extend this model and build complete Image-Speech conversion by converting captions of images to speech.This is very much helpful for blind people.
